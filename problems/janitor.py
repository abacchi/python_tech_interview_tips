    # The janitor of a high school is extremely efficient. By the end of each day, all of the schoolâ€™s 
    # waste is in plastic bags weighing between 1.01 pounds and 3.00 pounds. 
    # All plastic bags are then taken to the trash bins outside. 
    # One trip is described as selecting a number of bags which together do not weigh more than 3.00 pounds, 
    # dumping them in the outside trash can and returning to the school. Given the number of plastic bags, and the weights of each bag, 
    # determine the minimum number of trips the janitor has to make.\\

# Given weights : [1.99, 1.01, 2.5, 1.5, 1.01]

from collections import deque

bags = [1.99, 1.01, 2.5, 1.5, 1.01]
